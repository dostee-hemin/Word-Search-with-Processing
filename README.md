Make sure you have Java downloaded. You can find a list of versions [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

To use the application, run the "Word_Search.exe" file inside the main folder.

You can create your own categories with their list of words by editing the "Dictionary.txt" file. Each line in this text file is a category of words that can show up when you generate a new board.

The format is as follows:
[category name]-[list of words separated by space characters]

Example:
Space-Moon Asteroid Comet Supernova
